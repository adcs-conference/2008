<h3>Kal J&auml;rvelin: Quo vadis information retrieval research</h3>

<p>The talk begins by an analysis of the tradition of IR research
  based on the TREC approach. The structure of IR experiments, so
  characteristic for IR research, is discussed in detail, with IR
  effectiveness as the dominating dependent variable. The strengths of
  the approach in research and in practice are acknowledged. The talk
  then moves on to pointing out mounting challenges to IR (evaluation)
  and IR system development:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Sometimes there are no articulated information needs preceding
  information access. The searcher first needs to find a focus, then
  develop questions. Is it possible to support the searcher?</li>

  <li>Sometimes there are neither unique questions / queries nor
  unique right answers. The searchers are individual and inconsistent
  throughout. Is it possible to support the searcher?</li>

  <li>Practical IR is often a process, not a single shot at the
  database, while IR evaluation is by-and-large based on one-query
  sessions. IR processes have rarely been sufficiently described in
  recent times. Therefore they cannot be understood, properly
  supported, nor evaluated.</li>

  <li>Practical IR is rarely performed in vacuum at the center of the
  universe. Rather it is highly integrated with the other components
  of the searcher's information environment. This is unfortunately not
  reflected in IR evaluation.</li>

  <li>Relevance is dynamic and multidimensional while measured in the
  opposite way as stable, topical and binary. Simple measures like
  searchers' clicks are increasingly taken as indications of relevance
  while they are insufficient and do not reliably predict
  relevance.</li>

  <li>Searchers' task performance is independent of IR system
   effectiveness. People cope with clearly degraded retrieval systems
   as well as with better ones. Just their behavior is changed. Are we
   investing our research efforts optimally?</li>

</ul>

<p>All this suggests that, in addition to search engine development,
  IR (experimentation) might be deserving of other serious foci. These
  studies might not almost exclusively, and certainly not primarily,
  focus on search engine effectiveness as the paramount dependent
  variable. The talk finishes by discussing a cognitive approach to IR
  as a way for developing material theories on information access with
  more varied designs of dependent and independent variables. It is
  the author's view that, by lifting one's eyes from the search engine
  effectiveness fixation, it is readily understood that 80% of the IR
  terrain is unmapped, even from the CS viewpoint. Or, if no
  alternative approaches matter, we might close up shop.</p>

  Academy Professor at the Academy of Finland, working at the Dept. of
  Information Studies, University of Tampere. He holds a PhD in
  Information Studies (1987) from the same university. Kal's research
  covers information seeking and retrieval, database management, and
  structured documents; and linguistic and conceptual methods in
  IR. He has authored over 200 scholarly publications and supervised
  fourteen doctoral dissertations. Kal has served the ACM SIGIR
  Conferences as a program committee member (1992-2005), Conference
  Chair (2002) and Program Co- Chair (2004, 2006). He is an Associate
  Editor of Information Processing and Management (USA).</p>

<h3>Rosie Jones: Syntactic and semantic structure in web search
queries</h3>

<p>Traditionally, information retrieval examines the search query in
   isolation: a query is used to retrieve documents, and the relevance
   of the documents returned is evaluated in relation to that
   query. The query itself is assumed to consist of a bag of words,
   without any grammatical structure. However, queries can also be
   shown to exhibit grammatical structure, often consisting of
   telegraphic noun-phrases. In addition, users typically conduct web
   and other types of searches in sessions, issuing a query, examining
   results, and then re-issuing a modified query to improve the
   results. We describe the properties of real web search sessions,
   and show that users conduct searches for both broad and finer
   grained tasks, which can be both interleaved and nested.
   Reformulations reflect many relationships, including synonymy,
   hypernymy and hyponomy.  We show that user search reformulations
   can be mined to identify related terms, and that we can identify
   the boundaries between tasks with greater accuracy than previous
   methods.</p>

<p>Rosie Jones is a Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo!. Her
   research interests include web search, geographic information
   retrieval, and natural language processing. She received her PhD
   from the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University
   under the supervision of Tom Mitchell. She is co-organizing the
   WSDM 2009 Workshop on Web Search Click Data (WSCD09). She served on
   the Senior PC for SIGIR in 2007 and 2008, and is a Senior Member of
   the ACM.</p>
