<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>The Thirteenth Australasian Document Computing Symposium (ADCS
2008) was hosted by the <a href="http://www.ict.csiro.au/"> CSIRO ICT
Centre</a> at <a href="http://www.ict.csiro.au/page.php?cid=116">
Tasmanian ICT Centre, Hobart</a> on Monday 8 December, 2008.</p>

<p>This site will be a permanent repository of the material presented
at ADCS 2008.</p>

<h3>Aim of the symposium</h3>

<p>ADCS 2008 was an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in
document management and information retrieval to meet and present
their work.  The symposium aimed to cover all aspects of Document
Computing - issues ranging from the fundamentals of document
architectures and standards for markup, through storage, management,
retrieval, authentication and workflow, to active and virtual
documents.  The symposium emphasised both commercial and academic
issues by encouraging a variety of submissions.</p>

<p>ADCS was co-located
with <a href="http://www.alta.asn.au/events/alta2008/">ALTW</a>, the
Australasian Language Technology Workshop 2008 which was held
immediately afterwards on Dec 9-10th. There was a joint keynote
speaker and dinner for both conferences on Monday night.</p>

<!-- If there are sufficient papers submitted to either conference
that would interest the other (that is, ADCS submissions with an NLP
flavour, or ALTA submissions with a document focus), then a joint
paper session will also be arranged as part of the ADCS programme. We
particularly encourage such submissions. -->

<h3>Topics of interest</h3>

  following:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Natural Language Techniques and Documents (joint with ALTA)</li> 
  <li>Personalised Documents</li>

  <li>Web Documents </li>
</ul>

<h3>Posters</h3>

<p>There will be space available for (unrefereed) posters at ADCS.  If
you would like to put up a poster, let us know; we will allow a few
minutes before lunch for you to advertise it.</p>

<h3>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Submissions</font></font></h3>

Paper submissions must be sent to 
<a href="mailto:adcs2008@cs.rmit.edu.au"> adcs2008@cs.rmit.edu.au</a>
as a PDF
email file attachment (no exceptions) by the due date (no exceptions).
Submissions should comply with the <a href="paperguide.html">paper
guidelines</a>.

<p>All submissions must be original work, not previously published
elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or
journal.

<p><b>Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking
that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will
attend the symposium to present the work.</b> Note also that it is
insufficient for an author to register and pay for the symposium to
be regarded as fulfilling this obligation.

<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Full papers</font></font></h4>

Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research
issues.
Submissions should be at most 3000 words long; over-length submission
risk immediate rejection.
Refer to the <a href="paperguide.html">guidelines for
papers</a> for details of the required format.

<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Posters, Short papers and Industry
Status Reports</font></font></h4>

To encourage participation by industry and to provide a place for
work of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short
papers, up to a maximum of 1500 words.
A typical proposal might describe a leading-edge solution to a
practical problem in document management.
Short papers follow the same format as for full papers.

<p>Presentation of short papers will be via a poster session.
Accepted short papers will also be included in a separate section of the symposium proceedings.

<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Student Posters</font></font></h4>
We also encourage student to submit a one to two page summary of their
recent or proposed work to be presented as a speed talk (1 or 2 minutes)
and a poster. Students who take up this option will receive a discount on their registration fee.

<h4>
<font face="Georgia"><font color="#000099">Demonstrations</font></font></h4>
If you would like to give a demonstration of your system, please submit
an abstract following the same format as for short papers.
Demonstrations should be self-contained, and only limited hardware support will be available at the venue.

<p>Proceedings of the papers will be distributed to participants
at the symposium. Electronic copies of the papers will be made <A HREF="proceedings.html">available</A>
after the symposium.
All submissions will be fully refereed by a blind refereeing process,
at their full published length, and will comply with DEST criteria for
fully-refereed conference papers (category F1).
