<p>Registration is now open; here's
  the <a href="ADCS2008-rego.pdf">form</a>.</p>

<p>The registration fee is $50 (<strong>free</strong> for full-time
students) if paid in full prior to 1st December 2008.  After that
date, the price will rise to $80.  Both prices include GST and cover
attendance at all sessions; morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea, evening
canapes, dinner, and one copy of the Symposium proceedings on CD.  To
be eligible for the discount, student registrants must be studying
full-time in an Australasian tertiary institution.</p>

<p>There will be an informal dinner for those in Hobart on Sunday
night; this is not covered by the registration fee.</p>

<p>Registration payments can be made by credit card or cheque/money
order.  A registration and payment form (PDF document) is
<a href="ADCS2008-rego.pdf">here</a>.  Please print the form, complete
your registration and payment details, and fax/post it back.</p>

<p>Once we have processed your payment, a confirmation note and
receipt will be emailed back to you.</p>

<p>At least one author of each accepted paper or poster is required to
register at the time they lodge their final camera-ready copy.</p>

<p>Details of accommodation are
available <a href="location.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The symposium has finished and registration is (obviously) no
longer available.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks to</strong> Funnelback, NICTA, the CSIRO ICT Centre,
and RMIT University for their support.  This has helped us keep
registration fees low.</p>
